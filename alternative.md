# ALTERNATIVES TO USING GOOGLE CLOUD FUNCTIONS
There are numbers of  popular ways to conceal a backend server's ip adress 
from the client, however this different alternatives comes with their pros and cons of usage 
some of the available alternatives to achieving this includes

# using a proxy server 
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between the client and the server. When the client sends a request to the server, it first goes through the proxy server. The proxy server then sends the request to the server on behalf of the client, and the server sends the response back to the proxy server. Finally, the proxy server sends the response to the client. By using a proxy server, the client's IP address is concealed, and only the IP address of the proxy server is visible to the server, there are several popular proxy servers out there such as Nginx,Apache,HAProxy,Squid,Vanish e.t.c.
however based on hands on experience using Nginx as a reverse proxy in microservices, i could substitute Nginx as an alternative to using a cloud function, Nginx is a popular reverse proxy server, but it can also act as a proxy server, with  increased flexibility in customisation and configuration to fine tune the specific needs of the application,also nginx provides a cost effective approach to concealing ip adresses.

# Using a VPN: 
Another way to conceal the server's ip adress would be by using A Virtual Private Network (VPN). this allows the client to connect to a server securely and privately. When using a VPN, the client's IP address is replaced by the IP address of the VPN server. The client then sends the request to the server through the VPN server. The server only sees the IP address of the VPN server, and not the client's IP address.however it will be quite notable to understand that the use of vpns can increase network latency depending on where the vpn provider is located

# cloud function
Another go-to alternative would be using Aws lambda as an alternative to using google cloud function, although they both achieve the
same goal, but based on application needs one can choose this over using the google cloud functions as it is known to support a wider varieties of programming languages and a larger ecosystem of users and third party libraries

# Use a CDN: 
Usage of content delivery networks can also provide another alternative to concealing the client server' ip adresss, A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers distributed around the world. CDNs are used to improve website performance by caching content and delivering it from the closest server to the client. When making a GET request to an API, the client can use a CDN to route the request through a server in a different location. This way, the server IP address is concealed, and the CDN server IP address is visible instead.

# Summary
In summary, as a backend engineer, it's crucial to evaluate different alternatives and tools to conceal IP addresses using a proxy server, VPN, AWS Lambda, or a CDN. The choice of an alternative is heavily influenced by the application's specific needs and tailored to achieve the desired results.
